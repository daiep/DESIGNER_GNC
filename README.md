# DESIGNER_GNC
Voxel-wise DKI/DTI fitting script with Gradient Non-linearity Corrected (GNC) b-value and b-vector maps, based on the DESIGNER toolbox (_Ades-Aron B, et al. NIMG 2018_).
## Getting Started
Run DESIGNER_DKI_GNC.m for voxel-wise DKI/DTI fitting, with example multi-shell diffusion data to regenerate Figure 3 in _Dai E, et al. NIMG 2023_ (corresponding to slice 2).
  
Refer to the example data for the data format requirement:  
1.  b0/data/nodif_brain_mask.nii.gz, bvals, and bvecs: Preprocessed data with the recommended DESIGNER pipeline, including corrections for thermal noise, Gibbs ringing, Rician biases, susceptibilityâ€“induced geometric distortions, eddy-current-induced spatial distortions, and interslice motion.
2.  bvals_gnc.mat and bvecs_gnc.mat: Voxel-wise b-value and b-vector maps after GNC, based on the spherical harmonics provided by vendors (_Tan et al. JMRI 2013_). Format: #-of-b-val/b-vec * 3 (b-vec)/1 (b-val) * RO * PE * SL.
